Former Manly Methodist Church Manse,-33.794924,151.284883,,"Manly's Wesleyan or Methodist Church began in 1876 with the purchase of land from Henry Gilbert Smith, the ""father of Manly‟. In 1887, a wooden church opened on the site, then part of Belgrave Street. Prominent local Methodist Robert Mildwater lived next door. In 1894 the current stone building was erected as the Minister‟s residence. The stone above the front door was laid by H E Farmer, Mayor of Manly, on 9 June 1894. In 1900 a new site was purchased and the new church was opened on the corner of Raglan and Belgrave Streets, almost opposite the original site. In 1924, the Methodist Church moved to a third site, opposite Gilbert Park where it remains today.",former_methodist_church
Beresford House,-33.794827,151.285017,,This fine example of Manly shop-flats was built in the post-war prosperity of the mid-1920s. It reflected the increasing demand for modern retail shops with modest rental accommodation for the rapidly increasing population.,
Former Belgrave Grammar School,-33.794616,151.284971,,"The former Belgrave Grammar School, a boarding and day school for girls, was established by Miss C J Squire in 1906 (Sands’ 1907). It operated in a Methodist Church property in what was then Belgrave Street, before moving a few doors along to the fine Federation bungalow Orlando, in 1910. A small school with around twenty pupils, it operated until 1916. It is now the Manly Yoga and Meditation Centre.",

The bull-nosed verandah roof, square-headed windows and subdued mouldings date the building to c1890-1900.",rear_of_belgrave_terrace
People's Palace,-33.793528,151.285321,,"The Salvation Army Corps was established in Manly in 1894, under Captain Mary Smith. The foundation stone of the original Corps Citadel was laid on 14 September 1912. The People's Palace next door was completed in 1913. In 1992 the People's Palace was gutted, modernized by the Housing Department and a new low-income residential development completed on the site of an 1880s Victorian villa. The Salvation Army's General Booth came to Australia on four occasions from 1891 and lived in Manly for a short period, according to one local historian.",
Former Manly National School,-33.792693,151.285405,,"The first public school in Manly (and the Northern Beaches) was established in a stone building on land donated by H G Smith, on the corner of Carlton Street and Pittwater Road. The schoolhouse and teacher's residence was located to the rear, beneath the famous stone kangaroo in Kangaroo Street.",former_school
77 Pittwater Road,-33.792693,151.285405,,"This fine early federation-style two-storey villa was built on portion of the former National School site. Although used as flats and in a poor state of repair, it retains excellent original features such as the corner round turret showing a strong Queen Anne influence and Art Nouveau lead-lighted windows.",
Former site of Undercliff,-33.792693,151.285405,,"The present block of flats, ""Gornich‟ is part of the former site of Undercliff, built for George and Ann Smith in 1862.

Manly Drug Education and Counselling Centre,-33.792192,151.285252,,"This fine, stone cottage is now owned by Manly Council and leased to MDECC. It is a simple Federation-style cottage with a square bay in front of the protruding front room. Note the fretted 'sunrise' motif beneath the gable end that was a feature of many cottages built around the time of Australia‟s Federation in 1901.",
Federation Cottages and Semis,-33.791329,151.285122,,"These houses are typical of the transitional period between 1890 and 1910 when many houses combined elements of the Italianate and Federation styles. Features include: decorative flying gables over central entrance porches, with moulded bands to accentuate; bullnose corrugated iron verandah roofs; wooden friezes and light wooden columns; original terracotta ridge capping (terracotta tiles have often replaced original slate or iron roofs).",
Nixon‟s Buildings,-33.787787,151.284256,,"Among the earliest shop-flats in Manly, Nixon's Buildings were once the heart of the 'village' of north Manly. As the tram route to Manly Lagoon encouraged more development along Pittwater Road after 1903, so the demand for subdivision of land and local 'corner' shops increased. By World War One, the first shop-flats began to be built in Manly, with similar developments all along Pittwater Road in the 1920s (eg 141-155 Pittwater Road).",
Stuart Blinds Building,-33.788609,151.284476,,"This well-maintained, small factory and office for Stuart Blinds (est 1936) appears to have been built originally as a corner shop with residence above. Note the brick and stucco detailing on the upper levels.",
Manly Tram Depot,-33.786671,151.281602,,"The introduction of trams marked a new era in Manly. After two decades of lobbying, the first steam tramway between Manly Wharf and Manly (then Curl Curl) lagoon opened in February 1903. Patronage was poor outside summer, so horse-drawn cars replaced steam traction between July 1903 and October 1907. The first tramway ran along the Corso and North Steyne before turning up Carlton Street to join Pittwater Road to the Lagoon terminus (known later as North Manly). The Tram Depot was built near the Lagoon terminus in 1903. The tramway was extended to Brookvale in 1910, Narrabeen in 1913 and Harbord in 1925. The Manly to the Spit tramline opened in 1911.",manly_tram_depot
St Ives,-33.787036,151.284363,,"Probably built around 1880 (not c1860), St Ives, also known as The Gables, was used briefly by a coach proprietor in its early years, but was never a Cobb and Costage house. Built on the early land grant to Henry Miles, St Ives is sometimes confused with Miles' boarding house ""Ebenezer Lodge‟, c1858 nearby, built closer to the Lagoon. St Ives is built in the picturesque Gothic style, featuring high-pitched gables.",the_gables
Shop-flats,-33.787972,151.284803,,"Part of the rapidly developing 'village' of North Manly that followed the tramway and the subdivision of Farrell's Paddock (1905) and Rolfe's Estate (1910), several of these shops retain their original pressed-metal, Wunderlich ceilings and internal staircases to their flats.

Late Victorian stone cottage,-33.790376,151.285434,,"This simple symmetrical sandstone house suggests an earlier date. However the slow development of Pittwater Road beyond Carlton Street, and the bull-nosed verandah roof date the cottage to the 1880s or early 1890s. Similar cottages in nearby Whistler Street date to the 1880s.",
Late Victorian stone semis,-33.791597,151.285695,,"Two pairs of stone semi-detached cottages with similar facades that may suggest the same builder. The roof of 116-118 was rebuilt in the Federation period, probably around 1910. Although the symmetrical design and simple window and doortreatment suggest the post Regency period, a number of cottages and semis in this style were built in Manly up to 1900.",

Manly Beach Resort,-33.792487,151.285901,,"This site comprises several former late Victorian and Federation boarding houses, converted to 'backpacker' premises, as well as a modern motel and now in a sad state of disrepair and neglect prior to redevelopment. A heritage assessment in 2001 states of the corner building: “documentary evidence suggests that the 1870s house was totally replaced after the mid 1920s; however an area of early fabric may have been retained on the ground floor.”",
