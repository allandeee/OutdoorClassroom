Manly wharf,-33.800497,151.283862,In 1855 Smith built the first Manly wharf,"In 1855 Smith built the first Manly wharf, and soon after an intermittent ferry service started, used mainly by day trippers. Four years later he purchased shares in the paddle steamer Phantom, sometimes called Puffing Billy, and the first regular service began. The timetable advertised a 30 minute trip but in rough weather it could take an hour or more. Phantom could carry 166 passengers, whose only protection from the weather was a canvas awning stretched over the single deck. In the early 1860s if there were sufficient theatre-goers and others wanting to travel to the city in the evening, Phantom sailed to Sydney about 7pm and waited there to make the return trip. With engineer Robert Grant as superintendent, those arriving well before the 11 pm departure roasted potatoes in Phantom‟s boiler furnaces. Whisky, coffee and baked potatoes made a supper that everyone could enjoy on the journey home. This gathering was known as the Hot Potato Club. For nearly a century the Port Jackson Company developed and operated the ferry service. In 1972 it was taken over by Brambles Industries and two years later by the New South Wales Government. Hydrofoils were introduced in the 1960s, halving the time for the trip. They proved to be unreliable and costly to maintain and in 1990 were superseded by jetcats, which could transport many more passengers on each trip. The ferry service continues to be popular and transports commuters and millions of visitors to and from Manly every year across Sydney‟s magnificent harbour.",manly_wharf
Corso,-33.798722,151.285123,The Corso links Manly Cove with the ocean beach.,"The Corso links Manly Cove with the ocean beach. An existing track was widened by Henry Gilbert Smith in 1855 and named after a major street in Rome. Manly Council‟s original planting of Norfolk Island and Monterey pines and Moreton Bay and Port Jackson fig trees have been replaced by palms at this end of The Corso. Transport by tram was introduced into Sydney in the early 1880s. There was a local demand for trams from the 1890s, but it was not until 1903 that the first line in Manly opened. The route went from West Esplanade, down The Corso along North Steyne turning into Pittwater Road at Carlton Street and continued to the terminus near Manly Lagoon. This building still stands at the junction of Pittwater and Balgowlah Roads. The first trams were steam-powered but replaced by horse-drawn ones when passenger numbers declined. Steam trams were reintroduced in 1907 and later electric trams were used. The line was extended in stages to reach Narrabeen by 1913, but the plan to take the tram to Pittwater was never realised. In 1911 a single tramline was opened between Manly and the Spit. Until the first Spit Bridge was opened in 1924, travellers crossed the water by punt before joining another tram. When buses replaced the trams, a mock funeral service was held to farewell the last tram as it left Manly Wharf about 1.30am Sunday 1 October 1939. A wreath was placed on the front of the tram which, draped in black, travelled to the depot accompanied by the muffled beat of two drums. However the mood was not sombre as the crowd of passengers and followers sang such songs as „Pack up your Troubles‟ and „Auld Lang Syne‟.",corso
the Pier Hotel,-33.799058,151.284465,one of the first of Henry Gilbert Smith‟s buildings in Manly,"On the corner of West Esplanade and Belgrave Street once stood the Pier Hotel, one of the first of Henry Gilbert Smith‟s buildings in Manly, constructed the same year as the wharf. It later became known as the Grand Pier Hotel. The building was demolished to make way for the Hotel Manly, completed in1926. An Art Deco tower was added to the hotel in 1935. Art Deco was a decorative style of the 1920s and 30s using geometrical shapes and Egyptian and Greek motifs. A statue of Captain Phillip by sculptor Rayner Hoff was set in a niche in the tower facing The Corso. Rayner Hoff also created the sculptures on the Anzac Memorial in Sydney‟s Hyde Park. In 1989 the Hotel Manly was demolished and the statue is a feature of the apartments and shops which were built on the site in 1995.",the_pier_hotel
Gilbert Park,-33.798362,151.284648,the park formed a central feature of Henry Gilbert Smith‟s design for Manly.,"Cross The Corso and Belgrave Street to Gilbert Park. Originally twice as long extending as afar as Raglan Street, the park formed a central feature of Henry Gilbert Smith‟s design for Manly. The tennis courts cover what was the northern section of the park. The Uniting Church in West Promenade, formerly the Methodist Church, was built in 1924. The first Wesleyan Methodist services were held in a wooden chapel in Belgrave Street. Later a small brick church was built at the corner of Belgrave and Raglan Streets, before the construction of the present building with its decorative brickwork and domed tower. In Belgrave Street stands the courthouse built in 1923. Beside it stands the police station built in 1925. The first lockup, a stone building, was erected in 1866 at the corner of Sydney Road and Market Lane on land donated by Henry Gilbert Smith. Between 1979-1981 both the police station and the courthouse were extensively renovated, and further alterations to the courthouse in 1993 uncovered an old sandstone well. The aviary, built in 1977 in Gilbert Park, has become a sanctuary for injured rainbow lorikeets. For several years, it was a free-flight aviary where they could come and go as they pleased. The Caley Lorikeet Trust was established in 1985 to manage the shelter. Wild lorikeets use the Manly pines for roosting, and leave at daybreak to feed on nectar, fruits and seeds. They also visit people‟s homes but unfortunately many have suffered fatal illnesses caused by inappropriate feeding.",
St Andrew's Presbyterian Church,-33.795027,151.283242,opened in 1890,"Cross Sydney Road to the entrance of Ivanhoe Park. Across the oval can be seen St Andrew‟s Presbyterian Church which was opened in 1890. This Romanesque-style building, with its commanding bell-tower, was designed by John Sulman. In 1884 the first Presbyterian services in Manly were held at Fernbank, West Esplanade, the home of C H Hayes. Mayor of Manly",
Dalley‟s Castle,-33.7985,151.2846,This is all that remains of the residence Marinella,"It was built in 1881 by William Bede Dalley, lawyer and statesman. His wife, Eleanor Jane, died of typhoid when it was being built and Dalley himself only lived there for about three years. For many years it was owned by the McGaw family, but for a decade it was unoccupied and became dilapidated. Then in 1932 Rev C H Palmer purchased it and with renovations and extensions it became the Camden Grammar School. In 1939 this towering landmark was demolished and the existing flats, also named Marinella, were built.",dalleys_castle
Ivanhoe Park,-33.796717,151.2845,first wild flower show,"Manly‟s first wild flower shows were held in Ivanhoe Park. Native flora used to grow in abundance around Manly including Christmas bush which was used to decorate church pews and shop fronts at Christmas. Alderman C H Hayes initiated the first Manly Wild Flower Show in 1881 to raise funds for the extension of St Matthew‟s Church. It was held in the Ivanhoe Park pavilion, an old weatherboard construction with an iron roof. A canvas annexe housed orchids and ferns. The first show was for one Saturday afternoon only, but it became very popular and for about a decade it was an annual event lasting for several days. Stalls were decorated with beautiful bouquets and impressive floral representations of the British crown, hearts, harps, lakes and ships. On occasion children entertained visitors with maypole dancing. At night the grounds were illuminated with Chinese lanterns.",
Whistler Street,-33.796846,151.285148,,"Walk east along Sydney Road crossing Belgrave Street to Whistler Street. For some months in 1902 famous writer and poet, Henry Lawson and his wife Bertha, rented the dwellings Marlow and then Ladywood, both in Whistler Street. They were married in 1896 and had two young children. Henry Lawson wrote several poems about Manly, including The Cliffs, The Stranded Ship – about the Vincennes, a barque that went aground at North Steyne – and The Bards Who Lived at Manly which illustrates this period of his life. Bertha recognised his genius, but his frequent drinking bouts with bohemian friends and his inability to support his family led her to seek a legal separation in 1903.",
Manly Congregational Church,-33.796833,151.285013,The oldest existing ecclesiastical building in Manly,"The oldest existing ecclesiastical building in Manly is the Gothic Revival style Congregational Church. It was built in 1862 in sandstone with an attractive timber interior. The original stained glass is still in good condition but the slate roof has been replaced with concrete tiles. Two trustees of this church, John Fairfax and David Jones, were founders of important Sydney institutions. Fairfax was the first proprietor of the Sydney Morning Herald and David Jones started the chain of retail stores which bear his name. The foundation stone of the adjoining church hall was laid by Sir James R Fairfax in 1907. Before this church was built services were originally held in the house of John Trenchard Smith at the corner of The Corso and East Esplanade.",manly_congregational_church
End of Sydney st,-33.797266,151.287627,end point,"In 1989 this end of Sydney Road was closed to traffic and made into a pedestrian mall, linking it with The Corso. Here are the offices of the Manly Daily newspaper founded by Edward Lincoln. The first issue, a single folded page, came out on 28 July 1906. Apart from the first few months when it was printed in Sydney the Manly Daily was produced in Manly, but in 1989 production and printing moved to the headquarters of its proprietors the Cumberland Group in Parramatta. It was the first free newspaper to be published in New South Wales, and remains the only one to be published five days a week. Its growth has mirrored the development of Manly. The changing use of buildings reflects the needs of the community they serve. In 1916 Pacific Point was a cinema called the Britannia. It was renamed the Olympic in honour of Manly‟s champions: „Boy‟ Charlton, Dick Eve and Nick Winter, gold medalists in 1924 at the Paris Olympics. In 1934 as the New Olympic it was a venue for vaudeville theatre. Dobbs Bros converted the building into a furniture store in about 1936. In the post-war economic boom of the 1950s Waltons Ltd bought the site and opened their furniture and home appliances store on 3 December 1954. In the 1970s the building was converted into offices and an auction room. The shops and arcade linking Sydney Road with Henrietta Lane were constructed in 1983. The sculpture Wind and Wave at the junction of Sydney Road and The Corso it the work of distinguished Melbourne sculptor Lenton Parr, noted for his works in welded stainless steel. It was funded by the State government as part of a Bicentennial grant to Manly in 1988. The sculpture captures the essence of Manly‟s ocean beach. The Bicentennial project also included the construction of the Sydney Road Plaza.",
Steyne Hotel,-33.797093,151.287834,first hotel in junction,"The first Steyne Hotel at the junction of The Corso and North Steyne, was built by Henry Gilbert Smith in 1859. It has been rebuilt and renovated over the years, once having been destroyed by a fire. The present hotel was built in 1935 at a cost of £25,000. Manly beaches have existed in their present form for the last 6,000 years, during which time sea level has been more or less stable. Sand carried here by onshore currents accumulated on the rocky bar that connects the higher ground of North Head, Queenscliff and Fairlight. Prehistoric Manly was very different. About 126,000 years ago the sea level was higher than it is today. The valley between Shelly Beach and Queenscliff was beneath the sea, which penetrated far inland to Brookvale. In contrast, more recently, about 20,000 and 16,000 years ago, sea-level was at times 120 metres lower than it is today. The continental shelf was exposed and the shore was about six kilometers further east. There was a broad strip of grass and scrubcovered coastal plain, with lagoons and estuaries, which is now submerged.",steyne_hotel
the Royal Far West Children‟s Home,-33.798782,151.287806,Opposite the beach,"Opposite the beach stands the Royal Far West Children‟s Home. Family life in outback NSW was tough when Methodist pastor, Stanley Drummond, and his wife Lucy cast about for a remedy to relieve those who suffered most. Sea breezes and good food were the tonic they chose. In 1925 they brought a group of 58 children and six mothers to the coast for the first in a series of visits that became an annual event. The children they selected were physically disabled, malnourished and debilitated by the heat, dust and flies. The Drummonds‟ legacy has continued. This important organisation today still provides all country children with accommodation and education while they receive medical treatment.",
South Steyne,-33.798455,151.288904,Manly‟s Norfolk Island pines,"Local legend has it that the planting of Manly‟s Norfolk Island pines, Araucaria heterophylla, was begun by Henry Gilbert Smith. Over 500 trees flourished for almost a century until nearly half were damaged or destroyed in the 1960s by airborne pollution from the North Head sewage outfall. Rock star and environmentalist Peter Garrett, planted the first new pine at South Steyne in 1991. Subsequently 85 new trees were planted to begin the reconstruction of the crescent of pines along the length of the oceanfront. The National Estate listing of the pines and promenade was celebrated together with the first stage of Manly Council‟s replanting programme. Manly‟s success in providing welcome shade in these harsh seaside conditions was to provide a model for similar planting elsewhere in Australia.",
Dungowan,-33.799684,151.289349,,"In the block between Victoria Parade and Ashburner Street stands a building named Dungowan. Wealthy pastoralist and company director Leslie Sprague built Dungowan Flats in 1919 naming them after his country property Dungowan Station, 33 kilometres east of Tamworth. The Flats offered their privileged tenants a home with „every modern convenience‟, fully supplied with electricity, telephones and an „electric elevator‟. A commercial kitchen on the ground floor serviced the Restaurant De Luxe above. In 1925 the company Dungowan Ltd converted the Paramount Picture Theatre next door into the Cabaret Dungowan where grand social occasions were celebrated. An ice skating rink was added at the end of the 1920s, creating a complex of buildings extending to the corner of Ashburner Street and South Steyne.",dungowan
Manly history,-33.798779,151.290533,,"In 1908 the Sydney Morning Herald described Manly as „The Boulogne of Australia… it has been a common thing for 20,000 to 30,000 people to go over to Manly on a single afternoon… long lines of dressing sheds have been put up for them [surfbathers] under the seawall. The long curved avenue of Norfolk Island pines, which is the hallmark of Manly, is nothing except Australian. But the ocean beach itself might belong to the north coast of France… the long line of hire chairs, with startling parasols and many coloured skirts peeping over the edges of them, a bunch of drowsy saddled ponies, the donkeys and side shows, miniature railways.. entertain the crowd of bathers.’ Manly is historically important in the introduction of daylight swimming, recreational beach culture, surf lifesaving, and board surfing into Australian culture. Here Tommy Tanna, a native of Tanna Island in Vanuatu, taught 16-year-old Fred Williams to body surf at South Steyne in 1891 beginning the popularization of surf bathing. Daylight bathing was illegal until local newspaper proprietor William Gocher campaigned successfully to change Manly Council‟s bylaw. When legislation was introduced to permit bathing in daylight hours in 1903 the Manly community began campaigning for an organised surf rescue service. On Boxing Day that year, Eddie and Joe Sly, their fishing boat adapted for surf rescues, staged a carnival demonstrating a variety of rescue techniques.",
Manly Surf Club,-33.799643,151.29042,Manly Surf Club,"In July 1907 the Manly Surf Club held its inaugural meeting. Three months later the State coordinating body, the New South Wales Surf Bathing Association, was formed, the forerunner of today‟s Surf Lifesaving Association of Australia. New Zealander, Happy Eyre, the first lifeguard employed by Manly Council, started work in October 1907. He patrolled at North Steyne on alternate Sundays, with the members of the North Steyne Surf Bathers and Life Saving Club, beginning today‟s system of close co-operation between professional lifeguards and volunteers. The culture of the beach fostered an easygoing attitude and a determination to balance endeavour and relaxation which is a feature of the Australian character. It produced a cultural symbol, the bronzed Aussie lifesaver and led to Australia‟s outstanding record of achievement in water sports.",
Shooting spot,-33.800117,151.287451,,"The Bijou Theatre entertained audiences with a biotint called „A Trip to the Moon‟. The 32 moon scenes included „photographs‟ of its inhabitants. Audiences found „weirdly delightful‟…‟A beautiful Electrical Transformation Cloak Effect Act.‟ Entertainments described as „the latest successes from London and American theatres‟ were on the Bijou‟s schedule, with four daily performances. In the background an orchestra played day and night from a gaily illuminated band stand. At the gypsy tea rooms waitresses in Swiss costume served ices, ice creams, fruit salads, cakes and fancy pastries; and at the kiosk patrons could buy a glass of wine. Family parties were catered for at any time and supper parties could be catered for by arrangement. The grounds were enclosed by a 4-metre high fence that was decorated by landscape artist Ray Phillips. Steyne Court covered one and a half acres of land between Wentworth and Ashburner Streets. It opened daily from 2.30 to 10pm and on holidays 11am to 10pm. Admission was 6d for adults and 3d for children.",
Ashburner Street,-33.800752,151.288598,Ashburner Street history,"Ashburner Street contains a variety of architectural styles ranging from the Victorian era to the most recent, the south tower of The Kestrel, on the corner of Dungowan Lane, which opened in 1989. The oldest blocks of flats, erected during Manly‟s building boom in the 1920s and 30s, are nos 43, 41, 39-37, and opposite, no 34 Rowena and no 30 Winchelsea. The domestic style of Gallipoli Flats no 43 and The Astor no 41, differ remarkably from The Checkers next door. Its entrance, marked by grand columns and terrazzo stairs inlaid with the building‟s name, creates an image of material success and symbolizes the optimism of investors – a reminder that not everyone lost money in the Great Depression. Valentia at no 33 was built about 1918. The horizontal lines decorating the façade, repeated in the house number, the verandah steps and front fence, are precursor to the Art Deco style of the 1930s. The cottages at nos 20 and 18 are Victorian Italianate in style, featuring ornate timber fascias, and cast-iron columns and valances. Across the road the three cottages nos 23, 21, and 19 and no 10 opposite, were built just after World War I. The absence of ornamentation, noticeable where the houses retain their original appearance, indicates that they were typical workers‟ cottages of this period. Nos 16 and 14 are also workers‟ cottages built in the mid 1920s. Their brick entrances, stained glass, and intricately-carved verandah brackets, indicate that they were built in a time of greater prosperity. A small two-storied building at no 15A was built in the 1870s. it has a pressed metal skirt beneath its bay window, and its brick sidewall is rendered and scored to imitate sandstone. In the 1890s there was a timber merchant and coal and fuel depot here, whose delivery carts loaded in the yard behind the double gates. 8A Ashburner Street is particularly interesting because the folding doors that now form part of the street wall once opened daily onto the footpath. They are a remnant of the industry that operated from this combined factory and residence. In 1895, cordial manufacturer, H E Stevenson, lived here, and later Sanders and Co, carriers. The entrance to the residence is set back from the street, giving privacy to the family who lives there.",
Darley Road,-33.800991,151.288204,Darley Road hsitory,"Cross Darley Road using the pedestrian refuge up the hill and return again to Ashburner Street. Adastra, no 8, is an example of Art Deco architecture. The feature at the top, centre of the building has a waterfall motif, a theme typical of this style. Set back from the road at no 2 is Fairlands. Its architectural style is Victorian Rustic Gothic with contemporary additions. The Mayor of Manly 1897-98, F C Passau, built Fairlands in 1885. A plaque on the driveway wall gives a description of Fairlands‟ history. Opposite Fairlands at nos 7A and 5 there are two late Victorian terraces typical of high density working class suburbs, such as Glebe or Paddington. The iron lace verandahs provide a decorative façade to the modest building behind. Ashburner Street‟s architecture captures a microcosm of Manly‟s history. The cottages were the homes of workers and trades-people who serviced the 19th century mansions built on the hillsides above, and the visitors who stayed here. The flats of the 1920s and 30s and the units of the 1960s and 70s mark Manly‟s transition from village to dormitory suburb",fairlands
Broken column memorial,-33.801648,151.286589,Broken column memorial,"Cross East Esplanade to the broken column memorial. The broken column memorial is a fine piece of Victorian monumental architecture, erected in 1908. The broken column, signifying a life cut off before its natural term, is dedicated to troopers who died fighting in South Africa in 1900; also to F C Smalpage who drowned while attempting to save Miss M Thorpe – a reminder of how close the ocean is in the life of Manly. Recent excavations revealed a midden, evidence that Aborigines used to eat here. They were very skilled at catching fish, which provided the main part of their diet. Using lines, spears or nets, men and women fished from the shore and in canoes. They cooked fish on a small fire aboard their canoes, or on the shore leaving shells and fish bones to be found centuries later. East Esplanade was the focal point of the Venetian Carnivals. In 1913 for the first occasion 2,000 seats were set up here to view the spectacle. Over the years the carnivals grew, lasting for up to two weeks, and attracting thousands of people. Highlights mentioned in the Sydney Morning Herald in January 1913 included stalls, „chocolate wheels and other gambling devices‟, food, costumes, parades and fireworks. The climax was the water pageant, with all the boats and the harbour foreshore decorated with hundreds of Chinese lanterns, flags and streamers. At a time of limited lighting it was remarkable to see „Manly and its cove… wrapped in dazzling splendour.‟ Walk along E",
East Esplanade,-33.800039,151.285234,East Esplanade,"Walk along East Esplanade towards the wharf. The Norfolk Island pines here were planted in 1881, in the same year that the sandstone harbour wall was originally constructed. From Manly Council‟s inception, under its beautification scheme, it set out to provide a restful and pleasing atmosphere by planting a variety of large trees. The recent renovations here, improving paths and providing grassy shaded spaces for picnics, continue this tradition. A cargo wharf once stood next to the ferry terminal. In 1893 a group of Manly residents formed the Manly Co-operative Steam Ferry Company breaking the monopoly of the Port Jackson Company which provided both the passenger and goods service for Manly. The competition reduced fares and increased services. As there were disputes about the use of the wharf the Government took over the wharf from Manly Council and built a second wharf so both companies could operate from here. However, in 1896, the Manly Co-operative collapsed and thereafter its wharf was used exclusively for cargo. The cargo wharf was for great importance for the first quarter of the century, when cargo was no longer carried on the passenger ferries, but by a separate fleet. The opening of the Spit Bridge in 1924 allowed easier passage of goods by land, consequently water transport decreased dramatically and the cargo wharf ceased operation by 1928. Later it became a Fun Pier and was replaced by the existing complex in 1989.",

Only the façade remains of these early Gothic Revival terraces built in the 1870s. They were about to be demolished in the early 1990s but protests by residents persuaded Manly Council to save them by refusing demolition consent.",41_42_east_esplanade
Corso,-33.798243,151.286046,Corso history,"Cross by the pedestrian crossing opposite Wentworth Street and return to The Corso. In 1810 Governor Macquarie granted a total of 130 acres to Gilbert Baker and Richard Cheers. The boundaries extended from the southern side of The Corso to St Patrick‟s Estate. John Thompson‟s grant of 100 acres, on the northern side of The Corso, was purchased by Henry Gilbert Smith in 1853 and was quickly developed by him. D‟Arcy Wentworth bought both the Baker and Cheers grants and bequeathed them to his daughter Katherine Darley-Bassett. Henry Gilbert Smith leased this land in the 1850s. Legal complications regarding title prevented its sale until the Bassett-Darley Act of 1877 resolved the situation and the land was subdivided. A number of late 19th century buildings remain on The Corso although their ground floors have been altered. Many commercial buildings had balconies which not only created extra space but also provided shelter for people on the footpath.",
Aquarium,-33.798659,151.285707,19th century was the Aquarium,"One of the great attractions in Manly in the 19th century was the Aquarium, which was located approximately on the site of the present Westpac Bank. It was opened on 23 December 1886 by William Bede Dalley. Visitors could view a fine collection of fish, seals and tiger sharks. There was an octopus and an alligator too. The seal cavern and fernery were illuminated by electric light, Manly‟s latest novelty. The Aquarium was also an entertainment centre where concerts, dances and roller skating could be enjoyed in the grand hall. By 1893 the Aquarium had closed and the building was used to stage Manly‟s annual Wild Flower Show because the old pavilion in Ivanhoe Park had become too dilapidated.",

The sandstone St Matthew‟s Church designed by Edmund Blacket, architect of several churches in New South Wales, stood on the site of shops nos 46-55. Henry Gilbert Smith laid the foundation stone of the church in 1864. When The Corso was widened to 29 metres in 1877 the church encroached upon the street until it was demolished in 1928. The present church opened two years later on the site of the Victoria Hall.",

A low-arched gable pediment with two central semi-circular windows is framed by two pairs of small triangular pediments. Only two of the distinctive chimneys have survived.",
La Galerie,-33.798385,151.287554,La Galerie,on the corner of Rialto Lane stands the modern shopping complex La Galerie. In the late 1890s this was the site of the merry-go-round owned by „Sovereign‟ Smith – so named because he wore gold coins on his jacket and waistcoat. He made enough money from the merry-go-round to buy this block of land. His generosity to local charities made him a legend. He was particularly popular with children for whom he set aside free-ride days every month in the summer. In 1923 the Rialto cinema opened on this site. It was later renamed the Odeon but closed in 1960.,
