Eastern Hills Heritage Walk,ehhw,"When was the name Eastern Hill first used, and who decided upon this rather literal label for the sloping and often steep area to the east of the heart of Manly, fringed by beaches? History books provide no answer. But they do tell us of the area’s first inhabitants, and how the hill became covered in houses, suburbs and streets. Perhaps, once you have completed this walk, you may have some answers yourself."
Corso Heritage Walk,corso,"The Corso was laid out in 1854-55 by Henry Gilbert Smith. It first appears in Smith‟s 1855 plan for his new resort, then named Ellensville, after his first wife. The Corso was built as a boardwalk for early tourists across Manly‟s sand spit between the harbour pier and ocean beach. However, it may have followed an earlier Aboriginal pathway created by the local Kay-ye-my people. Named after Via del Corso in Rome, it was to be the focal point of Smith‟s new privatelyowned resort, later called New Brighton or Manly Beach. The early Corso included hotels, tearooms, a Vauxhall Gardens and maze, and promenades for day-trippers. An avenue of trees has long been a feature of The Corso. Smith planted a central avenue of Moreton Bay figs in the 1860s. In the late 1870s, the new Manly Council added Norfolk pines."
Pittwater Road Heritage Walk,pittwater,"Pittwater Road (and Belgrave Street) had their origins in the Aboriginal pathway north between Manly Cove and Barrenjoey. This pathway is clearly marked on the map drawn by William Dawes, dated March 1791. In the 1850s the early settlers around Manly Cove and Manly Lagoon (then known as Curl Curl Lagoon) would have used and expanded this pathway into a cart track. By 1859 the first Manly school was built in Carlton Street, just off Pittwater Road and several households were established in what was then known as Belgrave Street (to Carlton Street). H G Smith‟s map of 1860 for his proposed new suburb of Brighton, Manly Beach shows Belgrave Street extending as a rather grand boulevard northward from East and West Promenade. Belgrave Street led directly to Pittwater Road beyond Carlton Street. Pitt Water Road led north, then west toward the Lagoon, past the properties of Henry Miles and Thomas Youl on which houses had been built by 1860."
Manly Scenic Walkway,scenic,"What’s the prettiest way to get to Manly? Some say catching the Manly ferry, but those in the know will tell you otherwise – it’s the Manly scenic walkway. Beginning at Mosman’s Spit Bridge, this classic walk shows you some of the most picturesque parts of Sydney’s Middle and North Harbours and is part of Sydney's coastal walks. Follow the shoreline to Fisher Bay, Sandy Bay and Clontarf Beach then enter the Sydney Harbour National Park at Castle Rock. Make your way around Dobroyd Head and don't miss the Aboriginal rock engravings at Grotto Point or the amazing views from Arabanoo lookout. Pass by or take a dip at Reef Beach or Forty Baskets on your way to Manly. Fancy an ice cream at the Manly Corso after all that effort? Go on, you deserve it."
