Moreton Bay Fig tree,-33.802042,151.287005,Over a hundred years old,"This species was originally recommended for street planting throughout Sydney by Charles Moore, the Director of Sydney Botanic Gardens. It was later rejected as unsuitably large for streets, but its wide canopy has provided elegance and shade in many open spaces, and some fine examples will be seen on this walk. In the 1960s and 1970s, tables with inlaid chessboards sheltered under this tree, and men taught children cards and chess on their way home from school."
Manly Cove Launch Club,-33.802766,151.285795,Established in 1937,
Manly Rowing and Sailing Club Boatshed,-33.803062,151.285556,"Established in 1875, this was one of the earliest waterside clubs in NSW. Rowing was a popular sport then.","The shed is about 19 metres long, built to accommodate 8-oar shells or skiffs. In 1885 a second shed was added to house canoes and sailing boats, as well as boats that were raced for wagers. The first Manly regatta was initiated by the club in 1890. The club also took a prominent part in the Venetian carnivals. These were major events with parades, fireworks and a water pageant. They were called ‘Venetian’ because they were reminiscent of water-based life in Venice."
Manly Yacht Club,-33.803214,151.28532,Site of the former Gentlemen’s Baths,"This is the site of the former Gentlemen’s Baths, ‘the largest and most efficiently equipped gentlemen’s swimming baths in the state’, opened in 1892.6 In October 1926, a new Olympic pool with a grandstand to seat 1400 people was opened at a cost of £11,000. Boy Charlton, returned 1924 Olympic swimming champion, was present. This occasion was also the subject of the first broadcast on 2BL radio. The Baths suffered severe storm damage in May 1974 and were closed in April 1976. "
16 Foot Skiff Club,-33.803549,151.285071,Formed in 1923 as the Manly Sailing Club,Brightside Wharf used to stand just to the south of the clubhouse; for a while the ferry to Manly called here. The ferry was advertised as an attractive feature for potential land purchasers on this side of Eastern Hill.
Gocher Court,-33.803812,151.285082,Built in 1952 for the Housing Commission,"It provided much-needed accommodation, as housing was in very short supply after the Second World War. This marked the start of the spread of high-rise units which were to reach ever higher and blight Manly. However, in 1969 Manly Council attempted to limit the height of buildings and under the Manly Planning Scheme further restrictions were introduced in 1986."
Addison Road trees,-33.804672,151.286152,Avenue first planted in 1882,"Norfolk Pines are mixed with Port Jackson Fig trees, which were preferred to Moreton Bay Fig trees because they were smaller. These trees have provided welcome shade in the head of summer for over a hundred years."
Addison Road architecture,-33.806018,151.28477,Different styles and periods of architecture,"Note the variations in size of blocks of land in this street; in the last half of the 20th century, many blocks were subdivided to make room for additional housing. Can you recognize the following house styles – Italianate, Victorian Villa, Federation, Interwar Spanish Mission, Old English, Californian Bungalow, Post-war international, late Twentieth Century, and Post-modern?"
Peace Park at Manly Point,-33.808348,151.283346,One of several world-wide spots where signs proclaim the wish for peace throughout the world,"Organised by a Japanese peace movement, the stone near the road was dedicated in 1986. The plaque on the stone, and others inspired by the same movement, has the following wording: ""World peace begins in the hearts and minds of each individual – may we each seek harmony and peace in our daily lives."" View the harbour from the park, and look to the left for Little Manly Beach and Collins Flat,"
Farrell Boatshed,-33.806002,151.286487,Constructed in 1916,
Little Manly Beach,-33.806521,151.286712,This beach is a popular family beach and has long been a place of recreation for residents.,"Imagine a summer’s day in the1940s. The beach is very busy. Many people are hiring boats and fishing for kingfish and leatherjackets, and for blackfish near Collins Flat. Boating is very popular, and many of the surf clubs keep their boats here for training. In 1976 the house and boatshed were sole to Manly Council. The boatshed was demolished. The enclosed pool at the eastern end of the beach was constructed in 1880. It wasknown as the Crystal Baths. A keen eye can detect the faded work ‘BATHS’ on the rock face beside the pool. The original fencing was timber rather than metal. See the tiny pools in the rocks at the edge of the beach. Do you think these were formed naturally? Note that a shed once stood here. It was supported on timber poles."
Little Manly Point,-33.808299,151.287822,"Once an industrial site, is now a park","The Manly Gas Company’s works originally produced gas here for anyone within five miles (8 km) of Manly Post Office. The company purchased the land for £600 and paid half the cost of making good the road from the bottom of Stuart Street to Little Manly Point.20 Gas was used for lighting from 1884, and by 1923 there were 329 lights covering 30 miles (50 kms) of streets. Lamplighters climbed ladders to light each lamp with a taper, for which they were paid 25 shillings a week. From 1926 gas was also supplied to Warringah as far as Collaroy and Narrabeen, and several years later reached as far as Newport. The walk around the park was opened in 1992. The plaques show how the gasworks operated."
Spring Cove,-33.808146,151.291184,,"In 1975 a 12-metre strip of foreshore, part of the St Patrick’s Estate, was made available for a public walkway"
Quarantine Station,-33.805895,151.292707,Site of a hospital for seamen during World War 1.,"From 1832 ships would anchor in Spring Cove if there was anyone on board with a contagious or infectious disease. From 1837 accommodation was established on shore, and new arrivals were isolated there. From 1838 signal flags were flown at Cannae Point to warn of the dangers of approaching the Quarantine Station, and a yellow flag ordered ships with contagious passengers to take them to be quarantined. The signal mast, which was probably erected in 1853-4, has been repaired from time to time, most recently after lightning damage in 1986.The Station was also used to isolate Sydney residents. In 1900 there was an outbreak of bubonic plague, and cases from both the city and Manly were quarantined. It was last used for Vietnamese refugees, and was closed in 1984 and given to the state government. It became part of the Sydney Harbour National Park, administered by the National Parks and Wildlife Services. The Quarantine Station, a unique element of Australia’s heritage, was left almost untouched for most of the twentieth century."
Collins Beach,-33.808335,151.291401,The seclusion of this beach makes it possible to recall the life of the Aborigines before European contact.,"The mainstay of their diet was fish, and they were highly skilled at fishing in a variety of ways. They fished from the rocks, in the water, while swimming and from canoes; women used lines and men spears, with several points. Men made spears from the spikes of grass trees, hardened in the fire and tipped with bone. Both men and women used fine lines made of fibrous bark from Cabbage Tree palms or wattles, soaked in water for strength. Hooks were commonly made from shell or bone. Bait, other fish, was usually cast on the water. There was often a small fire aboard the canoe for cooking the fish. Children went fishing too, and had smaller spears suited to their size. Groups would gather on the shore to feast if a whale was stranded. In some other places along the harbour’s edge, Aborigines engraved the outlines of animals and people on the rock. Some hand stencils are also still present. Little visible remains here today of Aboriginal culture, except the occasional midden – a collection of shells and fish bones. But Aborigines still lived at Spring Cove from time to time, the last as recently as the 1950s."
