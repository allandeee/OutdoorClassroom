Eastern Hills Heritage Walk,ehhw,"When was the name Eastern Hill first used, and who decided upon this rather literal label for the sloping and often steep area to the east of the heart of Manly, fringed by beaches? History books provide no answer. But they do tell us of the area’s first inhabitants, and how the hill became covered in houses, suburbs and streets. Perhaps, once you have completed this walk, you may have some answers yourself."
Corso Heritage Walk,corso,"The Corso was laid out in 1854-55 by Henry Gilbert Smith. It first appears in Smith‟s 1855 plan for his new resort, then named Ellensville, after his first wife. The Corso was built as a boardwalk for early tourists across Manly‟s sand spit between the harbour pier and ocean beach. However, it may have followed an earlier Aboriginal pathway created by the local Kay-ye-my people. Named after Via del Corso in Rome, it was to be the focal point of Smith‟s new privatelyowned resort, later called New Brighton or Manly Beach. The early Corso included hotels, tearooms, a Vauxhall Gardens and maze, and promenades for day-trippers. An avenue of trees has long been a feature of The Corso. Smith planted a central avenue of Moreton Bay figs in the 1860s. In the late 1870s, the new Manly Council added Norfolk pines."
